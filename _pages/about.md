I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, focusing on “Multimodal perception”. I am affiliated with the M-PSI team at LIG Laboratory and LJK/SVH Laboratory.

Driven by a passion for integrating AI with real-world scenarios involving human-machine interactions, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and beyond, I am committed to advancing knowledge in my field. My current research interests lie in multimodal perception, with a specific emphasis on group emotion recognition in dynamic environments while taking into account the privacy of individuals.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in fundamental and applied mathematics, followed by a Master’s degree in the same field from 2017 to 2019 at Ecole Normale supérieure d’Haïti, Université d’Etat d’Haïti (UEH) with collaboration of Université des Antilles (UA) and Université de Poitier, France. I then pursued a Master’s degree in Econometrics and Statistics, focusing on Data Science, IT Security and Risk, from 2019 to 2021 at Université Claude Bernard, Lyon, France.  

You will find in here my detailed CV and publications.
